In FiveM, a modification for the popular game Grand Theft Auto V, there are several functions that are specific to the FiveM platform that you can use in your scripts.

Use the natives reference to find the list of all available functions : https://docs.fivem.net/natives/

## Registering a Command
To register a command that can be executed in the chat, you can use the `RegisterCommand` function.
```lua
-- Registering a command
RegisterCommand("hello", function()
    print("Hello!")
end, false)
```
The first argument is the command name, the second argument is the callback function that will be executed when the command is called, and the third argument is the "restricted" boolean : If this is a server command and you set this to true, then players will need the command.yourCommandName ace permission to execute this command
## Triggering an Event
To trigger an event that can be handled by other scripts, you can use the TriggerEvent function.

```lua

TriggerEvent("myEvent", "Hello, World!")
```
The first argument is the event name, and the following arguments are passed to the event handlers.

## Registering an Event
To register an event handler, you can use the AddEventHandler function.

```lua

    print(message)
end)
```

## Getting the Player's Position
You can use the GetEntityCoords function to get the player's current position in the world.

```lua
-- Getting the player's position
local player = GetPlayerPed(-1)
local x, y, z = table.unpack(GetEntityCoords(player, true))
```
The first argument of the function is the player entity and the second argument is a boolean indicating whether to use the global or the entity's relative coordinates.

## Creating a Blip
