# NUI Basics in FiveM

## Introduction

NUI (new UI) is a powerful tool in FiveM that allows developers to create custom user interfaces for their game servers. It enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this guide, we will cover the basics of NUI and how to get started with creating your own custom interfaces.

## Setting Up NUI

To start using NUI in your FiveM server, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new resource folder in your server's `resources` directory.
2. Inside the resource folder, create a `fxmanifest.lua` file.
3. Create an `html` folder inside the resource folder.
4. Inside the `html` folder, create an `index.html` file.
5. Add the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to the `index.html` file to create your custom interface.

## Example NUI Resource

Here is an example of a basic NUI resource structure:

```
resources/
└── my_nui_resource/
    ├── fxmanifest.lua
    └── html/
        └── index.html
```

### fxmanifest.lua

The `fxmanifest.lua` file is used to define the resource and its dependencies. Here is an example of a basic `fxmanifest.lua` file:

```lua
fx_version 'cerulean'
game 'gta5'

ui_page 'html/index.html'

files {
    'html/index.html',
    'html/style.css',
    'html/script.js'
}

client_script 'client.lua'
```

### index.html

The `index.html` file is where you will create your custom interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here is an example of a basic `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My NUI Interface</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, NUI!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
