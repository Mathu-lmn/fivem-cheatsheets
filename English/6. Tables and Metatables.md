# Tables and Metatables

In Lua, tables are a fundamental data structure used to store and organize data. A table is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the table. Tables can be used as arrays, dictionaries, objects, or a combination of these.

## Creating a Table
To create a table, you can use curly braces `{}` and separate the key-value pairs with commas. Keys can be either numbers or strings, and values can be any Lua data type, including other tables.

```lua
-- Creating a table
local myTable = {
    ["name"] = "John",
    ["age"] = 25,
    [3] = "hello",
    -- Tables can be used as values of other tables
    ["nestedTable"] = {
        ["key"] = "value"
    }
}
```

In this example, the table myTable has four key-value pairs. The first key "name" has the value "John", the second key "age" has the value 25, the third key 3 has the value "hello", and the fourth key "nestedTable" has another table as its value.

## Accessing Table Elements
You can access the elements of a table using the table name followed by the key in square brackets `[]`.

```lua
-- Accessing table elements
print(myTable["name"]) -- Output: John
print(myTable.name)     -- Output: John
print(myTable[3])      -- Output: hello
print(myTable.nestedTable.key) -- Output: value
```
## Metatables

Metatables are used to define the behavior of a table when certain operations are performed on it. A metatable is a table that can be set as the metatable of another table. The metatable contains metamethods, which are functions that define the behavior of the table when certain operations are performed on it.

```lua
-- Creating a metatable
local myMetatable = {
    __add = function(table1, table2)
        local newTable = {}
        for k, v in pairs(table1) do
            newTable[k] = v
        end
        for k, v in pairs(table2) do
            newTable[k] = v
        end
        return newTable
    end
}

-- Setting the metatable
setmetatable(myTable, myMetatable)

-- Using the metamethod
local myOtherTable = {
    ["city"] = "New York",
    ["country"] = "USA"
}
local myCombinedTable = myTable + myOtherTable
print(myCombinedTable.name)     -- Output: John
print(myCombinedTable.city)     -- Output: New York
```

In this example, the `__add` metamethod is defined to combine two tables into a new table. The setmetatable function is used to set `myMetatable` as the metatable of myTable. Finally, the `+` operator is used to combine `myTable` and `myOtherTable` into `myCombinedTable`.
